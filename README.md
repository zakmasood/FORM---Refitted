# FORM---Refitted
This is a ported / Entirely new version of the amazing FORM texture pack

Hey everyone dcybroz here!
If you want to create your own 3D models, you will need a couple of things:

-BlockBench , for model creation : https://blockbench.net/downloads
-A pixelart / Painting software (Paint.net is fine, MS paint is chad, I personally use Krita but its up to you)
-Place to save your files , Things can get messy, fast...

Thats pretty much it!

To get started, install blockbench from the link provided.
Once BlockBench is installed, open and create a new JAVA / BLOCK model 
Then, you can either import a .json from our texture pack here or use your own
You can then make your own model, then import it as JAVA/BLOCK model
Put this .json file into models/block, you can edit how
your custom model looks in the GUI tab in BlockBench.

To get custom textures to work, save them into textures/block folder.
If there are any issues:

GoodLuck!
